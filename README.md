twitter.me
==========

The mini-twitter project for Everything.Me, by Amit Davidi.

The project provides the following web-API calls:
 * /user/create?uname=*[User Name]* - Create a user in the system; The ID will be automatically set by the system and encoded into the response. 
   * *uname* is mandatory
 * 
 
 Do note that for all calls, the uid parameter is mandatory and is essentially used as an alternate means of identification in this session-less system.
